This GitHub repository ([https://github.com/manideepanasuri/SDC-Hackathon-FrontEnd](https://github.com/manideepanasuri/SDC-Hackathon-FrontEnd)) contains the frontend for a ride aggregating platform built during the SDC Hackathon. The application leverages React as the core JavaScript library for building user interfaces, along with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to efficiently create visually appealing and responsive components.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a focus on component-based structure and state management.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework providing low-level building blocks for rapid UI development.
    *   **DaisyUI:** Comprehensive UI component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, offering pre-built components for common UI elements.

## Features

*   **User Interface:** Designed and developed a user-friendly interface for the ride aggregating platform, featuring functionalities like:
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Ride booking and scheduling.
    *   Real-time tracking of available rides and driver locations (potential feature, depending on implementation).
    *   User profile management (potential feature).
    *   (Add other relevant features if implemented)
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensured the frontend adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Styling and UI Components:** Utilized Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface with easily customizable components.
